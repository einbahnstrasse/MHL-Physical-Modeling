### 3. Setup Procedure      

#### 3.1 Stage Plot   

_See the stage plot below for an overview of how things will look:_   

<img src="/MHL-Physical-Modeling/assets/images/stage.plot.april.7.v01.png" alt="stage plot Apil 7th">   

_This is not a duplicate of our Winter concert setup: We are not setting up 4-channel speakers for sound diffusion for this recording session, so don't bring the 8050s downstairs._   

_See below for an explanation of equipment and connections._    

#### 3.2 Equipment List      

_From the **Electronic Studio** (2.43):_   
* 1 x ART HeadAmp Headphone Amplifier (left on desk by Ilia)    
* 3 x beyerdynamic DT 770 Headphones (cabinet 6C)    
* 1 x ethernet-to-USB-C adaptor<sup>2</sup> (cabinet 2)   
* 2 x Sennheiser C214 condensor microphones (cabinet 2: I will bring down the C414s when I arrive)  
* Rubber mats (black) from studio (for covering cables on the floor)  

<sup>2</sup>Be sure to use the ones that _also have USB connections_. These ones are faster and provide 1K speed for network connections. If you use one of the dark connectors that only has the ethernet port, they are very slow.   

_From the **Upstairs Storage Room** (3.13e):_   
* 1 x gaffer tape for marking stage   
* 2 x power extension cords (for stage and house mix position)  
* 2 x power strips (for stage and house mix position)  
* 2 x microphone stands  
* 1 x Yamaha TF3 mixing console (in flight case; see photos)   
* 1 x Genelec 8030 loudspeaker (for on-stage monitor)  
* 2 x long network cables ("ethernet" cables) (not the long orange one, but 2 long cables that can go from the stage to mix position)   
* 1 x small audio snake (the kind we used at our Winter concert)   
* 5 x 10-meter XLR cables   
* ? x XLR-to-TRS ("jack") cables   
* ? x TRS-to-XLR ("jack") cables   

_From downstairs, below the Kammersaal, and elsewhere:_   
* 2 x large tables (see photos)   
* 3 x chairs (if none are availble in Kammersaal)   
* 2 x music stands (if none are availble in 3.13e)    

#### 3.3 Setup Procedure   

_HiWis divide the labor and direct others depending on their arrival._    

_Parnaz, Philipp, and Panos:_    

1. From downstairs, below the Kammersaal and near the entrance to the Grossersaal, bring 2 large tables to the Kammersaal and set them as marked in 3.1 Stage Plot, above. Here is where these tables are located: 

<img src="/MHL-Physical-Modeling/assets/images/tables.downstairs.jpg" alt="tables">   

_If any of these tables are unavaiable, there is also a table in 3.13e that can be used, and there is a small table for a laptop in the Kammersaal marked as "MHL Tontechnik."_   

2. Unpack the **Yamaha TF3 mixing console** and set it on **Table 1** as marked in 3.1 Stage Plot, above.  
3. Set up **power extension cords** and **power strips** on stage and at the mix position (Tables 1 and 2).   
4. Place the **ART HeadAmp** Headphone Amplifier on **Table 2**.  
5. Place **Goeun's laptop** on **Table 2**.  
6. Connect everything to the power strip and turn on power.  
7. Place a **chair** at **Table 1**, **Table 2**, and on stage for Margit.  
8. Place a **music stand** at **Table 2** and on stage for Margit.   
9. Place the 2 **microphone stands** on stage on either side of where Margit will sit.  
10. Place the **gaffer tape** on stage nearby the stands (to mark microphone positions later).
11. Place the **Genelec 8030** loudspeaker on stage in front of the microphone positions.   
12. Place the **snake box** on stage near the 8030 speaker.  
13. Run the **snake cable to the mix position** so that all of the XLR connections can be connected to the mixing console.   
14. Cover the snake cable from the stage with a **rubber mat** to make sure nobody trips over it.  

_Diego, Ilia, and Goeun (HiWis):_   

1. Find the **Dante network switch** underneath the Kammersaal stage (see the stage plot for location):

<img src="/MHL-Physical-Modeling/assets/images/network.dante.swtich.KS.jpg" alt="Dante switch">   

2. The <span style="color: orange;">**orange**</span> connections in 3.1 Stage Plot above are **Dante**. Using the photos above for reference, connect both network cables to the Dante switch (use any of the free ports you see in the photo) and run the cables to the mix position.   
3. See the diagram of the Yamaha TF3 mixing console's back panel below:  

<img src="/MHL-Physical-Modeling/assets/images/TF3.back.panel.png" alt="TF3 back panel">   

4. Connect one of the network cables to the Yamaha TF3 mixing console. There are 2 Dante plugs on the back of the mixer: plug this network cable into the mixer's **LEFT Dante port**.   
5. Connect the other network cable to **Goeun's MacBook Pro** on Table 2. Use the adaptor from the studio described in 3.2 Equipment List above.   
6. On stage, place the **Sennheiser C214 microphones** on their stands and position them close to where the accordion sits.  
7. Connect the microphones to the snake's input channels 1 and 2.  
8. At the console, connect the snake's output channels 1 and 2 to the console's input XLR channels 1 and 2. These are the **direct signal** ("close mic") channels.
